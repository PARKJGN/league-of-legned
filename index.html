      League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game
      in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities
      from an isometric perspective.<br>
      As of April 2021, there are 155 champions available to play.<br>
      Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points(XP)
      through killing enemies.<br> Items also increase the strength of champions,
      and are bought using gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures.<br>
      In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base.<br>
      Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.</div>
